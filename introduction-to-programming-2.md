## How To Manipulate Objects

If we were just making objects and not doing anything with them, programming would be useless. The way we manipulate objects is by using different statements to look for something specific to happen or we can use a function \(also known as a method\) to manipulate the object.  On this page i'll do a brief overview of both.

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
